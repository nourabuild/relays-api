cmd/api/main.go - serves as the entry point responsible for service initialization and graceful shutdown
internal/app - handles request handlers and route registration
internal/sdk - tools
internal/services - encapsulating service capabilities

Dependency Injection, Service-Oriented Design

## Goals

This repository template MUST provide a standardized foundation for microservices with:

- **CI/CD Ready** - Pre-configured pipelines for continuous integration and deployment
- **Observability** - Built-in metrics, logging, and tracing support
- **Production Features** - Health checks, graceful shutdown, and configuration management

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## MakeFile

Run build make command with tests
```bash
make all
```

Build the application
```bash
make build
```

Run the application

```

DB Integrations Test:
```bash
make itest
